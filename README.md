# CACTUS THE IMPALER
A pascifistic infinite runner where you play as the fiercest warrior time has ever known: __CACTUS__ (pronounced CACK-TOOS, and don't you forget it, mortal.) __CACTUS__ has slain many foes across the many battles of his bloody career. But now, the warrior heart of __CACTUS__ has softened! He is mortified by his past deeds! He no longer longs for death and destruction! Help guide __CACTUS__ away from the battlefield while sparing the enemies who cower in fear before you. Onward __CACTUS__, to gentler times!
