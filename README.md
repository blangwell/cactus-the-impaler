# CACTUS THE IMPALER
A pascifistic infinite runner where you play as the fiercest warrior time has ever known: __CACTUS__ (pronounced CACK-TOOS, and don't you forget it, mortal.) __CACTUS__ has slain many foes across the many battles of his bloody career. But now, the warrior heart of __CACTUS__ has softened! He is mortified by his past deeds! He no longer longs for death and destruction! Help guide __CACTUS__ away from the battlefield while sparing the enemies who cower in fear before you. Onward __CACTUS__, to gentler times!

## Technology
For this project I utilized HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and Javascript. I started by creating the scrolling motion with the `animate()` function.
```js
let x = 320;
let xVelocity = 4;
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, innerWidth, innerHeight);
    ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 100, 0, 1' // dark green!
    ctx.fillRect(60, 100, 32, 32); // cactus!
    ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)'
    ctx.fillRect(x, 100, 32, 32); // cowering foe!
    x -= xVelocity; // move
};
```
